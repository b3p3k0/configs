# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a configuration and documentation repository containing sanitized configuration files and collaboration guidelines. The primary artifact is **AI_AGENT_FIELD_GUIDE.md**, which defines the collaboration framework between AI agents and human interaction partners (HI).

## Working with AI_AGENT_FIELD_GUIDE.md

When revising or extending the field guide:

### Core Philosophy to Maintain
- **Context before code**: Always understand repo state before proposing changes
- **Plan with 5Ws**: Who/What/Where/When/Why with concrete file/module references
- **Show receipts**: Cite external ideas and attribute accepted contributions
- **Pause when unsure**: Seek clarification on conflicting instructions or risky operations

### Document Structure
The guide follows a modular structure:
1. **Orientation & Core Principles** - High-level mission and decision framework
2. **Collaboration & Communication** - Tone, prompting patterns, peer review protocol
3. **Delivery Playbook** - Implementation patterns, documentation standards, testing
4. **Safety, Troubleshooting & Recovery** - Escalation rules and recovery procedures
5. **Quick Reference** - Condensed checklist

### Editing Guidelines
- Keep sections focused and action-oriented
- Use bullet points for scanability
- Provide concrete examples in quotes where helpful
- Maintain consistent terminology (e.g., "HI" for human interaction partner)
- Preserve the "living document" principle - encourage future agents to add lessons learned

### Style Conventions
- Direct, concise language mirroring professional technical communication
- Lead with outcomes, follow with rationale
- Use parenthetical examples to clarify abstract concepts
- Avoid redundancy - each principle should have a clear home in one section

## Git Workflow

This repository uses standard git practices:
- Main branch: `main`
- Commit messages should be descriptive and reference specific sections when updating documentation
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes
